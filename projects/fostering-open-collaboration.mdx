# Will cross-company visibility into shared free and open source dependencies lead to cross-company collaboration and efforts to sustain shared dependencies?

Organizations that contribute to their free and open source dependencies often do so in isolation, looking only at their own dependencies and how important they are to the organization. By executing a common dependency analysis framework, organizations can easily share dependency information with consistency, opening up conversations about the importance of shared dependencies across organizational boundaries and across the wider open source ecosystem. Will cross-organizational visibility into these shared dependencies lead to cross-organizational collaboration, contribution and investment in dependency maintenance?
