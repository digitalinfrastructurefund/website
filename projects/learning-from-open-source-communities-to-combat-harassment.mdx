# Learning From Open Source Communities to Combat Harassment

This project is an oral history about the creation of codes of conduct (CoC) used throughout open source, namely JavaScript, communities. It collects and connects best practices, tips and tricks currently used throughout open source communities that focus on respect, inclusion and equity.

What can we learn from the history of JS Confs, Codes of Conduct and open source community meet ups to better understand how to respond to harassment at scale?
