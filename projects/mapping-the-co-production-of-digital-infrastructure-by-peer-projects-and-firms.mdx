# Mapping the co-production of digital infrastructure by peer projects and firms

This research project, which focuses on the sustainability of digital infrastructure, aims to understand the social costs and benefits of the co-production of digital infrastructure by volunteer or ‘peer’ projects and commercial firms. We focus on organisational factors, such as developers being paid by firms to develop Free and Open Source Software (F/OSS).
